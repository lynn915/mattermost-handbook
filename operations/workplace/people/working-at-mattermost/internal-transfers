*Internal Transfers*

Internal transfers have an informal and formal component. Informally, a team member is encouraged to be curious and seek to learn about other roles, teams, projects and a hiring manager. 
Once a team member and Hiring Manager align that a potential transfer may be a good fit, the Hiring Manager should discuss a potential transfer with the Manager and HR to kick off the formal transfer process. 
Depending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case by case basis.  

The intent of this discussion will be to: 
- Confirm headcount exists 
- Organizational impact (e.g. needs of team, product and company)
- Blindspot check for performance or other issues 
- Skillset transition (e.g. current level and experience within level & the new level & experience required for the role) 
- HR to confirm potential compensation impact, especially if the transition results in a decrease in compensation 
- Transition plan that balances the needs above with an aligned timeline
